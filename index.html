                <p> When inspired and talented individuals get together, amazing things can happen. Artbeat seeks to foster the artistic community at Brown. We bring together people that love art, no matter the medium.
                </p>
                <h4>Our goal:</h4>
                <p>
                Artbeat seeks to promote artistic expression and spread awareness of art and its benefits on Brown's campus. Inviting students of all ages, backgrounds, and experiences to participate in weekly visual arts activities and events, Artbeat strives to bring together artists through visual arts projects geared toward community service, therapeutic self-expression, or for the simple purpose of creating art in a comfortable space.
                </p>
                <h4>Who we are:</h4>
                <p>
                We're students and we love art! Artbeat was cofounded by Mandi Cai, Benjamin Shanahan, and Julia Foote (all class of 2017) and officially was registered as a student organization at Brown as of Spring Semester 2015! We've put so much work into making Artbeat into a reality and are so excited to see people being inspired by Artbeat, even at its early stages. We believe that Brown's student body has yet to realize its full artistic potential, but once that happens, with the help of Artbeat, student art and expression will be incorporated into every aspect of school and our lives at Brown, changing things for the better.</p>
                <h4>What we do:</h4>
                <p>
                For more concrete example of workshops, installations, events, and fundraisers we've planned and hosted, check out our <a class = "slide" href="#events-section">Projects</a> below. Our workshops are typically bi-weekly and installations are produced bi-monthly.
                </p>
                <p>
                Are you part of an awesome student group at Brown (or elsewhere, for that matter) and want to work with Artbeat on an event or project? <a class = "slide" href = "#contact-section">Contact us!</a> We'd love to hear from you and are open to any and all ideas.

                        'In Transition' is an exhibition about Providence's street art scene and its movement through different spaces. All art can be seen as ephemeral in nature, on display for a period of time and then stored away somewhere private only to be appreciated by a select few. Street art takes away that exclusivity, but often at the price of imminent demolition or removal. The art is not confined to space, instead embracing the space that it finds itself in. The spray paint's lifespan is at the mercy of the wrecking ball, but the sheer irony that its beauty comes from eventually being destroyed is what makes street art hauntingly beautiful.

So much of female representation has been problematic, like the female nude where the female is very passive. Their body is for people look at without them confronting it. I was interested in reversing the roles - what does it mean to translate the male figure into decorative, ditzy earrings and necklaces? What is the line where you're being assertive and what is the line where you're exploiting yourself?'">
