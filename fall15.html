                'In Transition' is an exhibition about Providence's street art scene and its movement through different spaces. All art can be seen as ephemeral in nature, on display for a period of time and then stored away somewhere private only to be appreciated by a select few. Street art takes away that exclusivity, but often at the price of imminent demolition or removal. The art is not confined to space, instead embracing the space that it finds itself in. The spray paint's lifespan is at the mercy of the wrecking ball, but the sheer irony that its beauty comes from eventually being destroyed is what makes street art hauntingly beautiful.
